				<h1>My life in a few paragraphs</h1>
				<p style="font-size:18px;">
					I was born in 1994 in Heidelberg, Germany. In 2000, however, my family moved to Innsbruck, Austria, where I spent all of my school years. Apart from the almost obligatory Austrian activity &ndash; skiing &ndash; I developed various interests in art, dancing and singing. In particular, I was singing in a choir and had small roles in two musicals at the Tyrolean State Theatre. I did not continue to pursue singing, but I still enjoy dancing.

                    At age 14, I decided to invest more time in one particular passion: Mathematics. After seeing an advertisement for the Mathematical Olympiad, I quickly discovered that I really enjoy solving the kind of problems posed there. I was particularly passionate about Euclidean geometry, but was also fascinated by number theory and combinatorics. In the years 2010-2012, I <a href="https://www.oemo.at/OeMO/Ergebnisse/Person/1245">successfully participated</a> at the national competitions of the Austrian Mathematical Olympiade. In particular, this led to a qualification and participation at the Middle European Mathematical Olympiad in 2011. One year later, in 2012, I placed 5th out of all participants in the second round of the Austrian national competition. Thereby, I qualified for the 53th International Mathematical Olympiad in Mar del Plata, Argentina, where I <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=21200">received a bronze medal </a>.       
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:18px;">
                    In 2012, I moved to Zurich to study Switzerland to study mathematics at the University of Zurich. While I mainly focussed on advancing my mathematical skills during my school years, I also had strong interest in physics, which is why I decided to choose this subject as a minor. I achieved my Bachelor's degree in 2015, and then continued with a Master in applied mathematics, with theoretical physics as area of application, at the ETH Zurich. During this time, I enrolled in several courses ("Differential Geometry", "General Relativity" and "Theoretical Cosmology") providing me with fundamental mathematical and physical knowledge for my later research work. During that time, I realized that theoretical cosmology is the right research field for me: I want to use my skills in physics, with a strong mathematical background, to help unravelling the mysteries of our Universe!

                <p style="font-size:18px;">
                    For my PhD thesis, I worked with <a href="https://www.ics.uzh.ch/~jyoo/home">Jaiyul Yoo</a> on developing precise formalism to account for general relativistic effects in large-scale structure observables, in particular cosmological weak lensing and galaxy clustering. After achieving my PhD degree in 2021, I moved to the University of Geneva as a postdoctoral researcher, working with associate professor <a href='https://blue-shift.co'>Camille Bonvin</a>. During my time in Geneva, my research focus shifte to the development of model-independent tests of gravity. I have as well developed an interest in pulsar timing arrays and their synergies with other probes of our Universe. Finally, in August 2025, I have moved to the United Kingdom, where I am working as a Research Fellow in Cosmology at the <a href=https://www.port.ac.uk/research/institute-of-cosmology-and-gravitation>Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation</a>, University of Portsmouth.

                <p style="font-size:18px;">
                    Apart from my scientific work, I am also passionate about communicating my work to the broader public. In the past, I have given <a href='https://www.iil.ch/en/conference-with-nastassia-grimm/'>outreach talks at schools</a>, and I have contributed to the YouTube channel <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecIS1y_xv0g'>Cosmic Blueshift</a>. Feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> &ndash; I am always happy to talk about my research and foster new connections!
