				<h1>Fall semester 2020</h1>

                    I am currently a teaching assistant for <a href=https://www.benmoore.ch>Ben Moore</a>'s lecture "Introduction to Astrobiology". Click <a href=https://www.ics.uzh.ch/~ngrimm/courses/ast201/index.html>here</a> if you are looking for the course website.

                <h1>Previous teaching activities</h1>
				<p style="font-size:18px;">
                    Since 2017, I have been a teaching assistant for different courses related to astrophysics/cosmology as part of my duties as a PhD student at the University of Zurich. Some of these courses, such as "Theoretical Astrophysics and Cosmology" (a joint course by the ETH and University of Zurich) are highly specialized and intended for physics Master students. In contrast, "Introduction to Astrobiology" is an interdisciplinary course, attended by students from many different fields (biology, physics, geology, philosophy etc.). 
                    
                   </p> 
                <p style="font-size:18px;">
                Prior to that, I was teaching programming and maths related courses during my Bachelor and Master studies. For more information, you can look at my <a href="CV_Grimm.pdf">CV</a>.
